            </div>

            <div class="bs4-text-left">The <strong>NGS Competence Center TÃ¼bingen</strong> (NCCT) was established in
                early 2018 with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dfg.de">DFG</a> (German Research
                Foundation) funding. Together with <strong>three other national centers</strong>, we aim at
                strengthening the use of <strong>high-throughput sequencing</strong> methods in Germany.<br />
                <br />
                The center offers <strong>automated</strong> high-throughput services and a rich portfolio of sequencing
                solutions using the latest <strong>Illumina</strong>, <strong>Pacific Biosciences (PACBIO)</strong>and <strong>Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)</strong>
                sequencers. As part of the <a href="http://qbic.life" target="_blank">Quantitative Biology Center</a>
                (QBiC), NCCT builds on established core facility structures and integrates with the existing
                infrastructure for data management and bioinformatics support.</div>
